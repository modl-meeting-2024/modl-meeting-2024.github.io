activities relevant to the [Collaboration on the Theoretical Foundations of
Deep Learning](https://deepfoundations.ai/).


The conference will be held in the main auditorium (**room 123**) of the HDSI building, UC San Diego campus in La Jolla [(3234 Matthews Lane, La Jolla, CA 92093 United States)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HtKJkbuMv1dA6zGt5).


See [the schedule]({{site.baseurl}}#schedule) below for the list of talks by
internal members of the collaboration and external speakers.

# Local Information



## Accommodation

A [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZHPIr5OTISS-6Yy9ZrsU8IaFqIMS6W5W1tXOWU0fno/edit?usp=sharing) of hotels within a 1-hour travel distance from HDSI building, UCSD (either by walking or via the Blue Line trolley).


## Transportation
If you are not within walking distance of campus, we suggest using rideshare or public transportation (SDMTS).

In particular, there is a [blue line trolley](https://www.sdmts.com/transit-services/trolley) stop (UCSD Central Campus station) very close to HDSI (<5 mins walk). It is quite quick and convenient, even all the way to downtown.

## Parking
Campus parking is very limited and is not recommended. You can check available options [here](https://transportation.ucsd.edu/visit/visitor/index.html). The [Gilman parking structure](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gilman+Parking+Structure,+3100+Gilman+Dr,+La+Jolla,+CA+92093/@32.8773774,-117.2338526,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x80dc06c5218d55eb:0xd07cbfc872e378aa!8m2!3d32.8773774!4d-117.2338526!16s%2Fg%2F1tdkgyrr?entry=ttu) is nearby. Note that most visitor spots are limited to two hours. Even though the app allows you to pay for longer periods, you will get a ticket after that time.

There is [free parking](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Torrey+Pines+Gliderport/@32.8898715,-117.2537813,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x80dc0693080cb29b:0x8f244f06aa6472e0!8m2!3d32.889867!4d-117.251201!16s%2Fm%2F04gvgnd?entry=ttu) at [Torrey Pines Gliderport](https://www.flytorrey.com/), if you do not mind a 30-minute walk to HDSI. The view from the Gliderport is spectacular.

If you have any questions, please contact the organizers.

# Reimbursements

MoDL will reimburse transportation costs up to $300 from the West Coast and $750 from elsewhere in the US, and up to a maximum of $270 per day for hotel stays, incidentals, and meals not provided at the workshop. Reimbursement requires receipts and covers up to three nights.

We will soon update the instructions to submit your reimbursement.
