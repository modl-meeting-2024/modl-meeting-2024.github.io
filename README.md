(ending at 4:30 p.m., with a picnic at The Point to follow) for research talks
and activities relevant to the [Collaboration on the Theoretical Foundations of
Deep Learning](https://deepfoundations.ai/).-->

Join us at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) from May 16th-17th for talks and
activities relevant to the [Collaboration on the Theoretical Foundations of
Deep Learning](https://deepfoundations.ai/).

- ***Scientific Program***: beginning **Tuesday, May 23rd at 11 AM CT**,
  ending **Wednesday, May 24th at 4 PM CT**.
- ***Full Program***: The meeting will conclude with a picnic at [The
  Point](https://www.promontorypoint.org/) after the scientific program ends,
  on **Wednesday, May 24th from 4 PM CT to 8 PM**.

See [the schedule]({{site.baseurl}}#schedule) below for the list of talks by
internal members of the collaboration and external speakers. We have also
planned a panel session, a "research speed dating" event, and a discussion
session for research topics/open problems for students, postdocs, and faculty
to enjoy.

Remote participation will be accommodated; see [below]({{ site.baseurl

# Local Information

## Venue
The conference will be held at UC San Diego campus in La Jolla (about 12 miles north of the San Diego International Airport).

Talks will be held in the main auditorium (room 123) of the HDSI building (3234 Matthews Lane, La Jolla, CA 92093 United States).

## Accommodation
A comprehensive list of hotels with recent rates, as of last summer (courtesy of Joel Yuen-Zhou) can be found [here](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/alt2024-hotels.pdf). Due to the size of the conference, we are not able to allocate room blocks. However, you can try checking whether they have a UCSD rate. Give HDSI (Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute) as the department.

## Transportation
If you are not within walking distance of campus, we suggest using rideshare or public transportation (SDMTS).

In particular, there is a blue line trolley stop (UCSD Central Campus station) very close to HDSI (<5 mins walk). It is quite quick and convenient, even all the way to downtown.

## Parking
Campus parking is very limited and is not recommended. You can check available options here. The Gilman parking structure is nearby. Note that most visitor spots are limited to two hours. Even though the app allows you to pay for longer periods, you will get a ticket after that time.

There is free parking at Torrey Pines Gliderport, if you do not mind a 35-minute walk to HDSI. The view from the Gliderport is spectacular.

If you have any questions, please contact the organizers.
