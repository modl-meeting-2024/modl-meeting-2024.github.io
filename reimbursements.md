# Reimbursements


MoDL will reimburse all travel expenses (airfare, train, bus, taxi, meals,
etc.) related to this meeting. You must keep all of your receipts. For charges
related to meals, **an itemized receipt must be included, and a signed copy must
be submitted in order to be processed.**

- For the purposes of business travel, domestic travel is defined as ‘travel to
  any destination within the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, and
  all U.S. possessions, territories, and entities with free association
  status.”  Travel to all other locations is considered foreign travel.
- The allowable expense for domestic travel is a standard **coach airfare** or
  its equivalent.  Domestic First Class or Business Class travel requires
  approval by the Chief Academic Officer and is allowed for the following
  reasons:
  - Physical disability
  - Lack of available space
  - Cancellation of service
  - Extraordinary situation

We will soon update the instructions to submit your reimbursement.
