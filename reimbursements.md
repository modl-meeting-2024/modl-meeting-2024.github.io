# Reimbursements


For MoDL affiliates, MoDL will reimburse transportation costs up to $300 from the West Coast and $750 from elsewhere in the US, and up to a maximum of $270 per day for hotel stays, incidentals, and meals not provided at the workshop. Reimbursement requires receipts and covers up to three nights.


For reimbursement, please email all your receipts to Kelsey at kjlarsen@berkeley.edu. If you're not a US citizen or permanent resident, let Kelsey know when you submit your request, as there may be extra steps involved.
