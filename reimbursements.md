# Reimbursements


MoDL will reimburse transportation costs up to $300 from the West Coast and $750 from elsewhere in the US, and up to a maximum of $270 per day for hotel stays, incidentals, and meals not provided at the workshop. Reimbursement requires receipts and covers up to three nights.


We will soon update the instructions to submit your reimbursement.
