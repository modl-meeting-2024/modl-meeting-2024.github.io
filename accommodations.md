# Local Information

## Accommodation
TBD

## Transportation
If you are not within walking distance of campus, we suggest using rideshare or public transportation (SDMTS).

In particular, there is a [blue line trolley](https://www.sdmts.com/transit-services/trolley) stop (UCSD Central Campus station) very close to HDSI (<5 mins walk). It is quite quick and convenient, even all the way to downtown.

## Parking
Campus parking is very limited and is not recommended. You can check available options [here](https://transportation.ucsd.edu/visit/visitor/index.html). The [Gilman parking structure](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gilman+Parking+Structure,+3100+Gilman+Dr,+La+Jolla,+CA+92093/@32.8773774,-117.2338526,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x80dc06c5218d55eb:0xd07cbfc872e378aa!8m2!3d32.8773774!4d-117.2338526!16s%2Fg%2F1tdkgyrr?entry=ttu) is nearby. Note that most visitor spots are limited to two hours. Even though the app allows you to pay for longer periods, you will get a ticket after that time.

There is [free parking](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Torrey+Pines+Gliderport/@32.8898715,-117.2537813,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x80dc0693080cb29b:0x8f244f06aa6472e0!8m2!3d32.889867!4d-117.251201!16s%2Fm%2F04gvgnd?entry=ttu) at [Torrey Pines Gliderport](https://www.flytorrey.com/), if you do not mind a 30-minute walk to HDSI. The view from the Gliderport is spectacular.

If you have any questions, please contact the organizers.
